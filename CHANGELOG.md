## [2.0]
This version changes the naming convention of the intermediate files created
in the output folder. A file called `1to2.sh` is included as a guide for renaming
the files if you'd like to preserve them. Otherwise, I recommend starting with
a fresh output folder.

- Maps now displayed in popup, this allows old maps and locked maps to have a
  place in papyri. Inspired by the Hermiton Herald.
